## Hello, I'm Cesar ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Microsoft Excel geek who recently got into Software Development. I enjoy the fact that you can tell the machine to virtually perform any task, and that opens new possibilities for me and those with whom I will work in the following months.


## My next projects

I'm looking to start working in ambitious projects and help all participants to achieve their goals. My creative mind paired with my passion for solving problems makes you want to work with me, independently of the nature of the project. 


## My skills

I'm currently familiar with Python and SQL.
